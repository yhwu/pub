In this video, the coach demonstrated how to return fast long backhand serve. There are a few key points:
- the ball is fast and only allows secondary instintive responce,
- do not draw back the hand,
- do not step back,
- step left or right to make sure the ball is inside the body, 
- go toward the bounce,
- use the ball's speed to quickly grab and brush the ball with a side top spin to make an arc,
- control where the ball land on the other side of the table.

In this video, Liu Jia Liang talked about a few critical tips.

- Loop half long ball. With good anticipation, take the ball early. Don't draw back hand, just go forward towards the ball. It’s easier to loop it over when the ball is above the net than when it’s dropping. Of course, when it’s already dropped, do a high loop. 
- Return deep push or fast serve to backhand. A quick grab and brush would do with a key point of restraining the swing. However, do not be afraid of using power when brushing, or do not lift or hit the ball. 
- Return high loop. The key point is timing and speed, not power. 
- Short drop and deep push. Hand and body move in sync. Do not draw back hand. Push with the body going forward.
- No power in attack. Mostly, the error is timing.
